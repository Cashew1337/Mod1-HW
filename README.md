# Mod1-HW
Repository to store the project(HW) for Module 1

## Module 1 Student Project
The purpose of this project was to take existing code, and refactor it, making it neater and easier to read.
Doing so will not alter what the code does.
I did this because having a large amount of unecessary or redundant code can make it harder for others to work on that code in the future,
so refactoring it allows us to clean it up and make it easier for people to follow.
